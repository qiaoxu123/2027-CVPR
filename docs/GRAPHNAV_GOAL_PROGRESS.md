# GraphNav goal progress

Branch: `2027-CVPR/graphnav-closedloop-sbf-parity`, based on `11e0409b322f08db4459888c6d38ba08547da730`. Goal remains active: full closed-loop navigation and >=95% SR / >=90% SPL of the local SBFNav baseline on identical Val Unseen evaluation. No acceptance level is achieved yet.

## Unified baseline — in progress

Located genuine local SBFNav epoch-14 best checkpoint, SHA256 `e991b4e46ebc20b9cf7a1e350a0993c75028e863b10b55df166acd4e59510885`, and immutable source/config snapshot. Historical selection used Val Unseen proxy: disclosed, not replicated for new GraphNav tuning. Shared rollout now separates public language/pose/resolved polygons from GT/evaluator labels, uses XY metrics, 20m radius, 20 macro decisions, 50m horizontal and 10m vertical limits, map bounds and ground+10..100m altitude limits. Original SBF has horizon/stagnation termination and no trained Stop. False-Stop Rate is null when no stop decisions exist.

128 evenly spaced Val Seen episodes: SR 44.53%, SPL 36.89%, OSR 61.72%, NE 32.96m, nDTW 27.55%, sDTW 14.68%, mean 15.94 moves, mean policy latency 47.56ms. All 128 trajectories/termination lengths reproduce historical checkpoint outputs exactly. Full Seen/Unseen rerun follows. Closed-loop denominator is 2470/2697 raw episodes; static retrieval denominator 2426/2679 unique map+text queries is intentionally separate.

79 tests pass. SBF tokenizer was incompatible with the prior GraphNav environment (protobuf absent); baseline is run using existing SBFNav environment without modifying either environment. Failed startup output/log retained. Raw depth/collision checks and true-camera intrinsics fidelity remain explicit simulator limitations; no improved safety claims are made.

## P0/P1/P2 — completed first validation, further controlled tests pending

See `BIDIRECTIONAL_VISUAL_LOCAL_VALIDATION_20261009.md`. 54 projection/ROI examples reviewed. Reliable filtered RGB regions and cross-frame pairs exist; source holes/coarse footprints are filtered, not called segmentation GT.

P1 five epochs total train-only 70.02s. G0/G1 matched A3 train-only 226.30/229.32s; G1 total pretrain+fine-tune 299.35s. G0 Unseen R@8=47.14%, NE54.68m; G1 46.40%,56.31m: no demonstrated transfer gain. Historical A3 remains 50.88%,48.42m and is preserved.

P2 five formal epochs 65.62s, peak allocated GPU4.10GiB; Unseen visual retrieval R@1/R@5=69.57/93.91% on115 identities. Frozen Large mean-patch control=66.96/81.74%. Footpath R@1 declines vs frozen baseline (40% vs60%, only10 samples). This is visual matching, not language localization or navigation success. Base/Large control, pose-indexed online cache, distance/visibility-stratified evaluation and aligned native Depth remain pending. No LoRA or Unseen-driven architecture tuning.

## Next experiments

1. Finish unified full SBFNav baseline and source/data/protocol audit.
2. Evaluate preserved A3 with a basic bounded waypoint policy in the same simulator, including all episodes even when landmark binding is unavailable.
3. Select trajectory/Stop training and confidence-gated graph/visual history additions using train/internal dev and Val Seen only, at most3 major configurations per stage.
4. Freeze final candidates before full Val Unseen comparisons, then assess paired episode/map uncertainty and acceptance levels.
